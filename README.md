# ALICE centrality estimators

Comparison of V0A, V0M and CL1 centrality estimators in p+Pb and Pb+Pb
collisions at 5.02 TeV

## What's here?

This repo contains
1. a script to generate Trento3D events, and
2. a script to plot the centrality dependence of dNch/dÎ· using different
   centrality estimators.

## Usage
```
./generate-events
./make-plots
```
